# Node.js Streams Assignment: "File Magic Stream"

Objective: Introduce students to Node.js streams by creating a program that reads a large text file, processes its content, and writes the modified content into another file using streams.

## Scenario:

You're working as a junior developer at a tech company that processes huge amounts of text data. Your manager asks you to build a small tool that reads data from a text file, processes it (e.g., converts text to uppercase), and writes the result to a new fileâ€”all while ensuring that the memory usage stays efficient. Streams to the rescue!

## Steps:

1. Setup:

-   Create a new project folder: file-magic-stream.
-   Inside the folder, run npm init -y to initialize a new Node.js project.
-   Install dependencies (if any): None needed for this task.

2. Assignment Tasks:

### Task 1: Create a Large Input File

-   Use Node.js to create a script (createLargeFile.js) that generates a file named input.txt with 1,000,000 lines of random text. Example content:

```mathematica
Line 1: Lorem ipsum...
Line 2: Node.js is awesome!
```

> > Hint: Use fs.writeFileSync or fs.createWriteStream with a loop to generate content.

### Task 2: Process File with Streams

-   Create a new script (processFile.js) that:

1. Reads the input.txt file using a readable stream.
2. Transforms the data by converting all text to uppercase (use a transform stream).
3. Writes the transformed data to output.txt using a writable stream.

### Task 3: Add Logging

-   Enhance your program to log:
    -   When the process starts and ends.
    -   The size of the input and output files in bytes.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional):

-   Add another transform stream that filters out lines containing specific words (e.g., "random").
-   Measure the processing time and log it.
-   Handle errors in the stream pipeline gracefully.
