# Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance

## Assignment 1: Creating Person and Superhero Classes

-   Create a class named `Person` that represents a human being.
-   Include the following properties:
    -   `name` (string)
    -   `height` (integer)
    -   `weight` (integer)
    -   `dateOfBirth` (date)
    -   method to get name (getName())
    -   and more
-   Create a class named `Superhero` that inherits from the `Person` class.
-   Include additional properties specific to superheroes, such as:
    -   `superpower` (string)
    -   `costumeColor` (string)
    -   override `getName()` to not reveal the real name of a superhero.

## Assignment 2: Creating Vehicle Classes

-   Create a base class named `Vehicle` with properties like `type` (string), `color` (string), and `year` (integer).
-   Create subclasses `Car` and `Plane` that inherit from `Vehicle`.
-   Add specific properties to each subclass (e.g., `numWheels` for `Car`, `maxAltitude` for `Plane`).
-   Create a `SuperheroVehicle` class that inherits from either `Car` or `Plane` and has additional properties like `specialFeatures` (array).

## Assignment 3: Creating Objects from the classes

-   Create a couple super heros, and make sure they have a vehicle

## Assignment 4: Extra

-   Try to improve whatever you can in the previous tasks.
