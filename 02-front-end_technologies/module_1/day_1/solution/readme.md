# Solution

The solution has styling on the about page. It uses the style tag in the head tag of the html file. This is not how it is usually done.

The style does include css you are not familiar with yet.

I have also included almost the same styling to the contact page, this does not include flex.

NOTE THAT IT IS NOT GOOD TO HAVE TWO SEPERATE WAYS OF SOLVING ONE PROBLEM IN THE SAME PROJECT!
