/*
Problem 1 - Easy
Use a 'for' loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
Example output: 1 2 3 4 5
*/

/*
Problem 2 - Easy
Use a 'while' loop to print numbers from 5 to 1.
Example output: 5 4 3 2 1
*/

/*
Problem 3 - Easy
Use a 'do...while' loop to print the message 'Hello, World!' 3 times.
Example output:
'Hello, World!'
'Hello, World!'
'Hello, World!'
*/

/*
Problem 4 - Intermediate
Write a 'for' loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.
Example output: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
*/

/*
Problem 5 - Intermediate
Use a 'while' loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 and print the result.
Example output: 55
*/

/*
Problem 6 - Intermediate
Create a 'for' loop that prints the multiplication table for the number 3 (from 1 to 10).
Example output:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
...
3 x 10 = 30
*/

/*
Problem 7 - Advanced
Use a 'while' loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to 21.
Example output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
*/

/*
Problem 8 - Intermediate
Write a 'for' loop to find the largest number in a set of given numbers: 3, 7, 2, 8, 5.
Print the largest number.
Example output: 8
*/

/*
Problem 9 - Challenging
Write a 'for' loop that counts from 1 to 100.
For multiples of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.
Example output: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz ...
*/

/*
Problem 10 - Challenging
Use a 'for' loop to find and print all prime numbers between 1 and 50.
Example output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47
*/

/*
Problem 11 - Intermediate
Write a 'for' loop to calculate the product of all odd numbers between 1 and 15.
Print the result.
Example output: 2027025
*/

/*
Problem 12 - Advanced
Use nested 'for' loops to create a pattern of stars ('*') like a right-angle triangle.
Example output for 5 rows:
*
**
***
****
*****
*/

/*
Problem 13 - Intermediate
Write a 'for' loop that checks if a given number (e.g., 13) is a prime number. Print '13 is a prime number' or '13 is not a prime number'.
Example output for number = 13: '13 is a prime number'
*/

/*
Problem 14 - Challenging
Write a script that calculates the factorial of a given number using a 'for' loop.
For example, if the number is 5, the output should be 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
Example output for number = 5: 120
