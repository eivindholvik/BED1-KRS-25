/*
Problem 1 - Easy
Write a recursive function named 'countdown' that takes a number 'n' and prints numbers from 'n' down to 1.
Example output for n = 5: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
*/

/*
Problem 2 - Easy
Create a recursive function named 'factorial' that takes a number 'n' and returns the factorial of 'n'.
Example output for n = 5: 120
*/

/*
Problem 3 - Intermediate
Write a recursive function named 'sumArray' that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements in the array.
Example output for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: 15
*/

/*
Problem 4 - Intermediate
Create a recursive function named 'fibonacci' that takes a number 'n' and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
Example output for n = 6: 8
*/

/*
Problem 5 - Intermediate
Write a recursive function named 'reverseString' that takes a string and returns the string reversed.
Example output for 'hello': 'olleh'
*/

/*
Problem 6 - Advanced
Create a recursive function named 'flattenArray' that takes a nested array (array of arrays) and returns a flattened array.
Example output for [1, [2, [3, 4], 5]]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
*/

/*
Problem 7 - Advanced
Write a recursive function named 'power' that takes two parameters: a base number and an exponent.
The function should return the base number raised to the power of the exponent.
Example output for base = 2, exponent = 3: 8
*/

/*
Problem 8 - Challenging
Create a recursive function named 'findGCD' that takes two numbers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).
Example output for 48 and 18: 6
*/

/*
Problem 9 - Challenging
Write a recursive function named 'isPalindrome' that takes a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Example output for 'racecar': true
Example output for 'hello': false
